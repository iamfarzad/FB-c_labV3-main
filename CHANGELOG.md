- Added pnpm scripts to streamline AgentDeskAI Browser Tools setup:
  - `pnpm mcp:bridge` → runs `@agentdeskai/browser-tools-server@latest` (bridge on port 3025)
  - `pnpm mcp:server` → runs `@agentdeskai/browser-tools-mcp@1.2.0`
  - `pnpm mcp:dev` → runs both concurrently
- Usage notes:
  - Load the Chrome extension (unpacked) from the repo's `chrome-extension` folder
  - In Cursor Settings → MCP Servers, configure:
    `{ "mcpServers": { "browser-tools": { "command": "pnpm", "args": ["mcp:server"] } } }`
  - Ensure the bridge is running before starting the MCP server

### Gamified Workshop Education - 2025-08-13

  - Suggestion engine: nudge ROI first for workshop when unused
- Telemetry hook: triggers `chat-capability-used` refresh so suggestions update

### Security and DB Policies - 2025-08-11
- Synced Supabase RLS with production:
  - conversation_contexts, intent_classifications, capability_usage: authenticated users can only read their own by email/session mapping
  - conversation_insights, follow_up_tasks, voice_sessions: authenticated users restricted via `leads.user_id = auth.uid()` for SELECT/INSERT
- Replaced permissive public policies on conversation tables with strict ownership checks
- Hardened DB functions:
  - Added `public.secure_function_template` with SECURITY DEFINER and empty search_path
  - Replaced `get_slow_queries` with SECURITY DEFINER and revoked PUBLIC EXECUTE
- Index maintenance:
  - Added missing `idx_leads_user_id`
  - Dropped a set of unused/duplicate indexes to cut bloat and planner noise

### Phase 1–2 Stabilization - 2025-08-10
### Voice Overlay Modernization - 2025-08-11
- Replaced legacy `VoiceOverlay` implementation with wrapper around `components/chat/tools/VoiceInput` (FbcVoiceOrb UI)
- Removed deprecated `hooks/useLiveSession.ts`; unified on WebSocket pipeline with VAD and TURN handling
- Ensures 16kHz PCM chunking, 500ms VAD silence threshold, and TURN_COMPLETE routing server-side

### Realtime Voice WS Handshake Stabilization - 2025-08-12
- Client: send `{ type: "start" }` immediately on WebSocket `onopen` to satisfy server handshake expectations; avoid duplicates via `sentStartRef`
- Client: keep `startSession` as fallback; skip duplicate start if already sent on open; improved state logs
- Server: attach `WebSocketServer` directly to HTTP(S) server instead of manual `handleUpgrade`
- Server: emit `{ type: 'connected' }` ack on connect, add keepalive pings and process-level error handlers
- Result: fixes immediate 1005/no-status closes and stabilizes session start → `session_started` → audio flow

### Voice Hook de-duplication + session gating - 2025-08-12
- Client hook `useWebSocketVoice`:
  - Log mount/unmount only once via `useEffect` (removed render-time spam)
  - Added `sessionActiveRef` to gate audio sending until after `'session_started'`
  - Queue audio frames while WS is open but session not yet ready; flush on `'session_started'`
  - Reset `sessionActiveRef` on socket recreate/close and on `session_ended`
  - Prevents repeated `session_started` cascades from early audio frames

### Unified “Book a Call” UX - 2025-08-12
- Added `MeetingOverlay` (`components/meeting/MeetingOverlay.tsx`) using a modal with Cal.com inline widget and lazy-loaded script
- Added `MeetingProvider` + `useMeeting()` (`components/providers/meeting-provider.tsx`), wrapped app in provider (`app/layout.tsx`)
- Wired CTAs to open the overlay:
  - Home (`app/page.tsx`): hero and “Schedule Free Consultation”
  - Consulting (`app/consulting/page.tsx`): primary buttons
  - Contact (`app/contact/page.tsx`): replaced inline embed with a clean button to open overlay
  - Chat (`components/chat/AIEChat.tsx`): SuggestedActions `meeting` opens overlay
  - Chat tool card (`components/chat/ChatArea.tsx`): meeting tool shows button to open overlay (no iframe inline)

- Conversational Intelligence Phase 1: session persistence hardened, idempotent `session-init`, stable `context` with ETag/304 and rate limits, unified `intelligence-session-id`.
- Conversational Intelligence Phase 2: added `POST /api/intelligence/intent` and `POST /api/intelligence/suggestions`, UI `SuggestedActions` and wiring in `AIEChat` (first user message → intent; suggestions rendered and actionable).
- Capability tracking: server-side recording for `translate` and `exportPdf`; progress chip and suggestions now reflect server snapshot.
- Suggestion engine: simple role/industry ranking.
- Tests: unit (intent detector, suggestion engine) and Playwright e2e for Phase 2 acceptance.
- Dev: fixed `scripts/check-dev-processes.js` (ESM→CJS) to allow `pnpm dev:safe` with port/process guard.

### UI Motion Polish - 2025-08-09
- Added reusable micro-animation components: `components/ui/fade-in.tsx`, `components/ui/motion-card.tsx`, `components/ui/stat-counter.tsx`

### Fixed - 2025-08-07 (Part 2)
- **🎯 COMPLETE FIX**: Restored audio chunk streaming to server
  - Reverted to Web Audio API-based voice recorder that sends continuous audio chunks
  - Audio chunks are now properly sent to server for buffering
  - Simple VAD detects 500ms of silence and sends TURN_COMPLETE signal
  - Server can now receive audio and forward to Gemini when turn is complete
- **🔊 Maintained PCM audio playback fix**
  - Raw PCM from Gemini is correctly decoded as Float32Array
  - AudioBuffer is manually created from PCM data
  - Supports both 16kHz and 24kHz sample rates

### Fixed - 2025-08-07
### Conversational Improvements - 2025-08-07
- Added `ActivityChip` and parsing in `ChatArea` to render inline activity markers without card wrappers
  - Use `[ACTIVITY_IN:Label]` and `[ACTIVITY_OUT:Label]` in assistant text; UI renders small chips
- Expanded assistant system prompts (text and voice) with F.B/c profile, services, workshop, abilities, and fun persona
  - `app/api/chat/route.ts` base prompt updated
  - `server/live-server.ts` systemInstruction updated

### Translation Feature - 2025-08-07
- Backend: Added `POST /api/translate` using Gemini for text translation with validation and activity logging
- Frontend: Added per-message translate action in `components/chat/ChatArea.tsx`
  - Quick translate to Spanish (ES) button on assistant messages
  - Renders translated text inline beneath the message

- **🎯 CRITICAL FIX**: Fixed PCM audio decoding in WebSocket voice functionality
  - Replaced incorrect `decodeAudioData` usage with manual PCM to Float32Array conversion
  - Now properly handles 16-bit little-endian PCM audio from Gemini Live API
  - Audio playback now works correctly with both 16kHz and 24kHz sample rates
- **🔊 Fixed audio response handling**: Removed incorrect audio/mpeg MIME type
  - All Gemini audio responses are now correctly treated as PCM, not MPEG
  - Unified audio queue handling for both 'audio' and 'gemini_response' messages
- **🎤 Improved VAD (Voice Activity Detection)**:
  - Lowered voice detection threshold from 0.01 to 0.005 for better sensitivity
  - Added comprehensive logging for VAD state debugging
  - Fixed TURN_COMPLETE signal triggering after silence detection
- **📝 Added debugging improvements**:
  - Enhanced logging throughout the voice pipeline
  - Added volume level logging for VAD debugging
  - Better error messages for audio playback failures

### Secure WebSocket Implementation - 2025-01-15

#### Security
- **HTTPS/WSS Protocol Upgrade**: Implemented secure WebSocket connections to resolve Mixed Content security errors
- Added SSL certificate support for local development using mkcert-generated certificates
- Upgraded server/live-server.ts to support both HTTP (production) and HTTPS (local development) protocols
- Updated client WebSocket URLs to use secure `wss://localhost:3001` connections
- Enhanced security compliance for HTTPS contexts preventing browser blocking of insecure connections

#### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Local development now requires SSL certificates (localhost.pem, localhost-key.pem)
- WebSocket server automatically detects environment and uses appropriate protocol (HTTP/HTTPS)
- All client WebSocket connections now default to secure protocols (wss://)
- Port configuration: Production uses port 8080 (Fly.io), Local development uses port 3001
- Improved connection logging with protocol detection and security status

#### Fixed
- Resolved Mixed Content security errors in browsers when connecting to WebSocket server
- Fixed WebSocket connection failures in secure HTTPS contexts
- Enhanced cross-browser compatibility for secure WebSocket connections
- **🎯 CRITICAL FIX**: Added missing `responseModalities: ['AUDIO', 'TEXT']` parameter to Gemini Live API configuration
  - This enables Gemini to respond with both audio (Puck's voice) and text (transcript)
  - Completes the full two-way voice conversation functionality
  - Resolves issue where audio was sent to Gemini but no responses were received

### Silero VAD Integration - 2025-08-06

#### Added
- **Advanced Silero VAD Integration**: Replaced custom voice recorder with professional-grade Silero Voice Activity Detection
- Neural network-based speech detection with configurable thresholds
- Automatic speech start/end detection using machine learning models
- Enhanced audio processing with 16kHz sample rate optimization
- Real-time volume visualization with Silero VAD feedback
- Comprehensive error handling for VAD initialization and operation

#### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Migrated VoiceInput component from `useVoiceRecorder` to `useSileroVAD`
- Improved voice detection accuracy and responsiveness
- Enhanced user interface with Silero VAD status indicators
- Updated toast notifications to reflect advanced VAD capabilities
- Better integration with WebSocket voice system

#### Technical Improvements
- Added `@ricky0123/vad-web` dependency for Silero VAD functionality
- Created `useSileroVAD` hook with configurable parameters:
  - `positiveSpeechThreshold`: Threshold for detecting speech (default: 0.5)
  - `negativeSpeechThreshold`: Threshold for detecting silence (default: 0.3)
  - `minSpeechFrames`: Minimum frames to consider as speech (default: 3)
  - `preSpeechPadFrames`: Frames to include before speech starts (default: 8)
- Proper cleanup and resource management for VAD instances
- TypeScript support with proper error handling

### Voice System Refactoring - 2025-08-06

#### Changed
- **useWebSocketVoice Hook Refactoring**:
  - Removed legacy `sendAudioChunk` function (was redundant wrapper)
  - Renamed `handleAudioChunk` to `onAudioChunk` for consistency
  - Renamed `handleTurnComplete` to `onTurnComplete` for consistency
  - Simplified public interface to only export necessary functions and state
  - Clean API now provides:
    - State: `session`, `isConnected`, `isProcessing`, `error`, `transcript`, `audioQueue`
    - Control Functions: `startSession`, `stopSession`, `sendMessage`, `playNextAudio`
    - Voice Recorder Callbacks: `onAudioChunk`, `onTurnComplete`

#### Voice Activity Detection (VAD) Improvements
- **Optimized silence detection parameters**:
  - Lowered silence threshold from 700ms to 500ms for better responsiveness
  - Reduced voice detection threshold from 0.005 to 0.002 for improved sensitivity
  - Added comprehensive debug logging for VAD decisions
  - Now properly sends TURN_COMPLETE signal when user stops speaking

#### Voice Recorder Integration Contract
- Established clear contract between `useVoiceRecorder` and `useWebSocketVoice`:
  - `onAudioChunk`: Called when voice recorder has audio data to send
  - `onTurnComplete`: Called when silence is detected (user finished speaking)
  - Ready for seamless integration in VoiceInput component
